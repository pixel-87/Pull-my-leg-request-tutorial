# Pull-my-leg-request-tutorial
An open challenge to submit comical punchlines to my jokes to demonstrate how pull requests can enable collaborative working.

Couldn't think of any punchlines but there is this.
A man decided to join a monastery where you were only allowed to say two words every 10 years.
After 10 years in the monastery the head monk summons him and says ‘You’ve been with us for 10 years. What two words would you like to say.’ 
The monk replies ‘I’m hungry’, so the head monk organises for an extra ration be given to him each day. 
After 20 years the head monk calls him in again and asks ‘What two words would you like to say?’ 
The monk replies with ‘Too cold’, so the head monk organises for him to get another blanket. 
After 30 years the head monk calls him in and says ‘What two words would you like to say’. 
The monk replies with ‘Wanna leave’. 
The head monk says ‘I’m not surprised. You’ve done nothing but complain since you’ve been here’.
